You acknowledge that such a date is just an estimation and is subject to change. We will continue to update you on the progress of your order and any changes to the estimated delivery date. Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control. See clause 22 for our responsibilities when this happens.
	2. Delivery is complete once the Goods have been unloaded at the address for delivery set out in your order and the Goods will be at your risk from that time.

	10. **Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind.** Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind, you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you will have to pay us compensation. Where we have begun making the made to order products you will be liable for all time and material costs incurred at the time of ending the contract.
